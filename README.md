## [Parrot OS + KDE + i3 installation &amp; configuration](https://github.com/alembiq/parrotKDEi3)

This isn't anything fancy, just my basic "/etc/skel" to be used on [Parrot Linux](https://parrotlinux.org/) 
with KDE and [i3 tilling manager](https://i3wm.org/). There are also few extra scripts I'm using basically 
everywhere (someone should just write some documentation for them). I should also point out, it's far from 
perfect, it's just good enough for shortening the time I need to install new machine.

### Install

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alembiq/parrotKDEi3/master/scripts/install-parrot.sh
chmod u+x install-parrot.sh
./install-parrot.sh
```


#### Changelog

- 12.6.2020 configurator for Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th generation (sound, mic, wwan)
- 3.10.2019 updated to Parrot 4.7 KDE
